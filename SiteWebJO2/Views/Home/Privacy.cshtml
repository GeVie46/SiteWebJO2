          A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
          numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored
          by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each
          time the browser requests a page from the server.

          expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
